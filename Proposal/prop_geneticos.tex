\section{Introduction}
In the present days, technologic growth specially in the programming field, represents and important issue, taking big part on solving a variety of topics, implementing algorithms as a tool. * Genetic algorithms are evolutionary algorithms, more broadly belonging to the Biologically Inspired Computation, useful for optimization problems. Its structure is inspired firmly on the field of genetics and Mendelian biology, specifically populations, gene frequency, chromosomes, genes, alleles, and so on in terms related to genetics; on the other hand it applies genetic processes such as evolution, recombination, mutation, heredity and others to improve the algorithm's efficiency for its goal which is combinatorial optimization.

\section{Objectives}

\subsection{General Objective}

To implement a C++ library of genetic algorithms.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

Specific Objectives are:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item To understand genetics algorithms method as evolutive algorithm.
\item To describe genetic algorithms method and some aplications in which this algorithm could be efficient.
\item To implement an C++ library of genetic algorithms.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}


The goal of the investigation would be to create a free genetic algorithm library written using C++, in other words, we pretend to create a headers (.h) directory which will contain all the function statements of the library and another directory of source files (.cpp) which is gonna contain the function implementations. The objective is to create a dinamic library, for so we pretend to create and .so final archive, that will be compiled through cmake.
\\
The function implementations will be based on bibliographic studies featuring the general theory of genetic algorithms to understand the data structure to exert in the function load up, evaluation, selection, crossing, mutation, and recombination. Besides we pretend to search pseudocodes or implementations in other languages, of the mentioned functions, so by the side with the bibliographic study, we can understand the structures of those and be in capacity of replicate and execute in a proper way the genetic algorithms.
